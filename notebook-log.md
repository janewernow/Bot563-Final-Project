# Data Set: Beaver Phylogeny
I found my data set from a paper titled "The Beavers Phylogenetic Lineage Illuminated by Retroposon Reads." 
This data helped researchers conclude that beavers (Castoridae) are more closely related to Kangaroo rats (Geomyoidea) within a mouse-related clade than squirrels (suborder Sciuromorpha) which were previously thought to be their closest phylogenetic relatives. 
I believe this data set has been through the QC steps; I have not personally made any alterations to the data set from the paper.
